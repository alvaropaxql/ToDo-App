# 2Do List App
Todo list app made both in vanilla JavaScript and React. New todos can be created or added to the old ones, checked as completed and removed from the list. Todos can also be filtered by 'completed' and 'uncompleted'.

The implementation is based on a tutorial made by [Dev ED](https://developedbyed.com), in vanilla Js and in React, with a few slight changes.

A few more features and corrections will be added in the future.

#### Purpose
The aim of these two practices is to refresh, remember and keep up the habit of coding.
